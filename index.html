      My favorite hobby, that I am always embarrassed to talk about, is watching
      professional wrestling. I grew up watching it as a kid and stopped once I
      got a little

      . I started watching old matches from my childhood recently and got back
      into watching new stuff again. There is great wrestling on the indies, as
      well as big new companies doing really interesting stuff. There are also a
      lot of international companies in Japan and Mexico that do great stuff as
      well.

      The reason I like watching it is because of the storytelling. There are
      really good stories of triumph and trials. Really good stories of
      friendship and betrayal. There are

      stories of not feeling good enough and feeling alone. There are stories
      told in the ring through the athleticism, acrobatics, and physical acting!

      There are also stories being told between companies now. The

      that had been shut for years has been opened. Excluding the largest
      company out there, pretty much every other company is working with another
      and letting their performers be at whatever show they wish to tell their
      story. It is really similar to how the Marvel cinematic universe has
      become! This style of storytelling goes way back to the early popularity
      of wrestling. There are performers returning after years of quitting that
      had become disillusioned with the whole idea of professional wrestling.
